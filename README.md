Attached in data folder is a sample weekly mess menu. I have coded the following 5 functions:
1) Created a function that takes day and meal (e.g., breakfast, etc.) as input and returns the corresponding items available for that meal.
2) Created a function that takes day and meal as input and returns the number of items in that meal.
3) Created a function that takes day, meal and item and checks if the given item is in that particular meal or not
4) Created a function that systematically converts the entire menu into json and saves this data as a json file in the same directory
5) Using the above data, created a struct that contains the day, date, meal and the items in that meal. Furthermore, also created a method that prints the details of each meal instance
